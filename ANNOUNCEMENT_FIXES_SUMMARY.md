# Teacher Announcement System - Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Column Mismatch Error
**Error**: `SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'type' in 'field list'`

**Root Cause**: The `save_announcement.php` API was trying to insert columns that don't exist in the teacher database's `announcements` table.

**Solution**: Updated `api/save_announcement.php` to use the correct database schema:
- Removed non-existent columns: `type`, `target`, `priority`, `is_active`, `teacher_name`
- Updated to use correct columns: `target_audience`, `target_class_id`, `target_grade`, `target_section`, `status`, `is_pinned`
- Added smart mapping logic to convert frontend parameters to database fields

### 2. Missing View and Edit Pages
**Issue**: Links to `view_announcement.php` and `edit_announcement.php` returned 404 errors

**Solution**: Created two new pages:

#### `teacher/view_announcement.php`
- Displays full announcement details
- Shows view count statistics
- Displays target audience information
- Shows status and metadata
- Provides edit and delete actions

#### `teacher/edit_announcement.php`
- Form to edit existing announcements
- Pre-populated with current announcement data
- Updates all announcement fields
- Validates teacher ownership before allowing edits
- Supports changing status (draft/published/archived)

### 3. Student Portal Integration
**Issue**: New teacher announcements needed to appear automatically in student portal

**Solution**: Already implemented in previous integration:
- `student/announcements.php` loads announcements via AJAX from `api/get_announcements.php`
- API merges both school and teacher announcements
- Auto-refresh every 30 seconds to show new announcements
- Visual distinction between teacher and school announcements

## How It Works Now

### Teacher Creates Announcement

1. **Teacher navigates to** `teacher/announcements.php`
2. **Clicks** "New Announcement" button
3. **Fills form**:
   - Title (required)
   - Content (required)
   - Type (general, important, event, reminder)
   - Target Audience (all, students, specific class)
   - Start/End dates
   - Pin option (for high priority)
4. **Clicks** "Publish Announcement"
5. **API processes** (`api/save_announcement.php`):
   - Validates teacher authentication
   - Maps form data to database schema
   - Inserts into teacher database with `status='published'`
   - Returns announcement data with teacher info
6. **Announcement appears**:
   - Immediately in teacher's announcement list
   - In student portal within 30 seconds (auto-refresh)
   - Filtered by student's grade/section if targeted

### Student Views Announcement

1. **Student navigates to** `student/announcements.php`
2. **Page loads** announcements via `api/get_announcements.php`
3. **API fetches**:
   - School-wide announcements from student database
   - Relevant teacher announcements from teacher database
   - Filters based on student's grade and section
4. **Displays** merged announcements with:
   - Purple badge for teacher announcements
   - Blue badge for school announcements
   - Teacher name or "School Administration"
   - Priority indicators
   - Read/unread status
5. **Auto-refreshes** every 30 seconds for new announcements

### Teacher Edits Announcement

1. **Teacher clicks** "Edit" on announcement
2. **Redirects to** `teacher/edit_announcement.php?id=X`
3. **Form loads** with current announcement data
4. **Teacher modifies** fields and clicks "Save Changes"
5. **Updates** in database
6. **Changes reflect** in student portal on next refresh

### Teacher Views Announcement

1. **Teacher clicks** "View" on announcement
2. **Redirects to** `teacher/view_announcement.php?id=X`
3. **Displays**:
   - Full announcement content
   - View count statistics
   - Target audience details
   - Status and metadata
   - Edit and delete options

## Database Schema Mapping

### Frontend Form â†’ Database Fields

| Form Field | Database Column | Type | Notes |
|------------|----------------|------|-------|
| `title` | `title` | VARCHAR(255) | Required |
| `content` | `content` | TEXT | Required |
| `type` | N/A | - | Not stored, UI only |
| `target` | `target_audience` | ENUM | Mapped: 'all', 'specific_class', 'specific_grade', 'specific_section' |
| `target` (class_X) | `target_class_id` | INT | Extracted from 'class_123' format |
| `pinned` | `is_pinned` | TINYINT(1) | Boolean |
| `teacher_id` | `teacher_id` | VARCHAR(20) | From session |
| `start_date` | `start_date` | DATE | Defaults to today |
| `end_date` | `end_date` | DATE | Nullable |
| N/A | `status` | ENUM | Always 'published' for new announcements |

## Known Limitations

1. **Delete functionality**: View page has delete button but backend not implemented yet
2. **Grade/Section targeting**: Currently only supports class-based targeting; grade and section targeting needs UI updates
3. **Rich text editor**: Currently plain text only
4. **File attachments**: Not supported yet
5. **Real-time notifications**: Uses polling (30s) instead of WebSockets

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement delete announcement functionality
2. Add grade and section targeting in UI
3. Add rich text editor (TinyMCE or similar)
4. Support file attachments
5. Implement real-time notifications via WebSockets
6. Add email notifications for high-priority announcements
7. Analytics dashboard for teachers (who viewed, when, etc.)
8. Comment/reply functionality
9. Announcement templates
10. Bulk operations (delete multiple, archive old, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### Announcement not showing in student portal
**Check**:
1. Announcement status is 'published'
2. End date is NULL or in the future
3. Target audience includes the student's grade/section
4. Student portal auto-refresh is working (check console for errors)

### Cannot edit announcement
**Check**:
1. Logged in as correct teacher (ownership validation)
2. Announcement exists in database
3. Teacher ID matches announcement's teacher_id

### Database errors
**Check**:
1. Both student and teacher databases are accessible
2. Database credentials in `config/database.php` are correct
3. Tables exist and have correct schema
4. Foreign key constraints are satisfied

## Support

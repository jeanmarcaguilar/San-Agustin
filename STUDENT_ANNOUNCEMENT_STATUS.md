# Student Portal - Teacher Announcements Status

## ✅ ALREADY WORKING!

The student portal is **already correctly configured** to fetch and display teacher announcements. Here's what's in place:

### Backend (PHP) - `student/announcements.php`

**Lines 58-115**: Fetches teacher announcements from teacher database
```php
// Get teacher announcements from teacher database
$teacher_conn = $database->getConnection('teacher');
$grade_level = $student['grade_level'];
$section = $student['section'];

// Query filters announcements by:
// - Published status
// - Active date range
// - Target audience (all, specific grade, specific section, specific class)
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Connects to both student and teacher databases
- ✅ Fetches school announcements from student_db
- ✅ Fetches teacher announcements from teacher_db
- ✅ Filters by student's grade and section
- ✅ Merges both announcement types
- ✅ Sorts by priority (high → medium → low)
- ✅ Adds source tracking ('teacher' vs 'school')

### Frontend (JavaScript) - `student/announcements.php`

**Lines 1256-1314**: AJAX loading via API
```javascript
function loadAnnouncements() {
    fetch('../api/get_announcements.php')
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            data.announcements.forEach(announcement => {
                container.appendChild(createAnnouncementElement(announcement));
            });
        });
}
```

**Lines 1317-1450**: Creates announcement cards with visual distinction
```javascript
const sourceInfo = {
    'teacher': {
        icon: 'fa-chalkboard-teacher',
        color: 'text-purple-600',
        bgColor: 'bg-purple-50',
        borderColor: 'border-purple-200'
    },
    'school': {
        icon: 'fa-school',
        color: 'text-blue-600',
        bgColor: 'bg-blue-50',
        borderColor: 'border-blue-200'
    }
};
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- ✅ Purple badges for teacher announcements
- ✅ Blue badges for school announcements
- ✅ Shows teacher name
- ✅ Priority indicators
- ✅ Read/unread tracking

### API Endpoint - `api/get_announcements.php`

**Already configured** to merge announcements from both databases:
- ✅ Fetches from student_db (school announcements)
- ✅ Fetches from teacher_db (teacher announcements)
- ✅ Filters by student's grade/section
- ✅ Returns merged JSON response

## Why Teacher Announcements May Not Appear

If teacher announcements aren't showing, it's likely due to:

### 1. No Published Announcements
**Check:** Are there any announcements with `status = 'published'` in teacher_db?

**Solution:** Create announcements via teacher portal:
```
1. Login as teacher
2. Go to teacher/announcements.php
3. Click "New Announcement"
4. Fill form and click "Publish Announcement"
```

### 2. Target Audience Mismatch
**Check:** Does the announcement's target audience match the student's grade/section?

**Example:**
- Student: Grade 5, Section A
- Announcement target: Grade 6, Section B
- Result: ❌ Won't show

**Solution:** Create announcement with matching target:
- Target Audience: "All Users" OR
- Target Audience: "Students Only" OR
- Target Audience: Specific class matching student's grade/section

### 3. Expired Announcements
**Check:** Is the `end_date` in the past?

**Solution:** Set `end_date` to NULL or a future date

### 4. Database Connection Issues
**Check:** Is teacher_db accessible?

**Solution:** Run test script:
```
http://localhost/San%20Agustin/test_student_announcements.php
```

## Testing Guide

### Step 1: Run Test Script
```
http://localhost/San%20Agustin/test_student_announcements.php
```

This will show:
- ✅ Student data
- ✅ Teacher announcements in database
- ✅ Which announcements each student can see
- ✅ Simulated API response

### Step 2: Create Test Announcement

**As Teacher:**
1. Login: `http://localhost/San%20Agustin/login.php`
2. Navigate: `teacher/announcements.php`
3. Click: "New Announcement"
4. Fill:
   - Title: "Test Announcement"
   - Content: "This is a test"
   - Target Audience: "All Users" or "Students Only"
   - Pin: Check (for high priority)
5. Click: "Publish Announcement"

### Step 3: Verify in Student Portal

**As Student:**
1. Login: `http://localhost/San%20Agustin/login.php`
2. Navigate: `student/announcements.php`
3. Look for:
   - **Purple badge** with "Class Announcement"
   - Teacher name (e.g., "Jean Marc Aguilar")
   - Your test announcement title

**If not visible:**
- Wait 30 seconds (auto-refresh)
- OR click browser refresh
- OR check console for errors (F12)

## Database Schema Reference

### Student Database (student_db)
```sql
-- students table
grade_level INT(11)
section VARCHAR(10)

-- announcements table (school-wide)
is_active TINYINT(1)
priority ENUM('low','medium','high')
start_date DATETIME
end_date DATETIME
```

### Teacher Database (teacher_db)
```sql
-- announcements table (teacher-specific)
teacher_id VARCHAR(20)
status ENUM('draft','published','archived')
target_audience ENUM('all','specific_class','specific_grade','specific_section')
target_grade INT(11)
target_section VARCHAR(10)
target_class_id INT(11)
is_pinned TINYINT(1)
start_date DATE
end_date DATE
```

## Filtering Logic

A student sees a teacher announcement if:

```
status = 'published'
AND (end_date IS NULL OR end_date >= TODAY)
AND (
    target_audience = 'all'
    OR (target_audience = 'specific_grade' AND target_grade = student.grade_level)
    OR (target_audience = 'specific_section' AND target_grade = student.grade_level AND target_section = student.section)
    OR (target_audience = 'specific_class' AND target_class_id IN student's classes)
)
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No announcements available"
**Cause:** No published announcements match student's grade/section  
**Solution:** Create announcement with target_audience = 'all'

### Issue: Teacher name shows as "Teacher"
**Cause:** Teacher record missing or not linked  
**Solution:** Check teachers table has matching teacher_id

### Issue: Announcements not refreshing
**Cause:** JavaScript error or API failure  
**Solution:** Check browser console (F12) for errors

### Issue: Purple badge not showing
**Cause:** Source field not set correctly  
**Solution:** Verify API returns `source: 'teacher'`
